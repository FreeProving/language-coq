{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wno-orphans #-}
-- |
-- This module contains orphan instancs to use string literatls to refer to
-- variables in terms, which is convenient when building expressions in the
-- Haskell code (e.g. in Monad.hs).
--
-- Orphans are frowned upon in libraries, but not quite as bad in programs.
-- We still put them in a separte module, to make it (somewhat) clear where
-- they are used.
